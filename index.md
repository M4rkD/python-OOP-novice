Object-oriented programming is a popular technique for structuring software,
particularly in larger software projects being developed by larger groups
of people. In this lesson we will use the tools for object-oriented programming
provided by the Python programming language to learn how it can be used
to write modular, reusable components for research software.

> ## Prerequisites
>
> This lesson assumes some level of familiarity with the Python programming
> language. If you have not previously used Python, and in particular if you
> are unfamiliar with programming in general, then we would recommend reading
> through Software Carpentry's introductory 
> [Programming with Python][swc-python] lesson before
> embarking on this one.
